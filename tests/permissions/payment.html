            This test page demonstrates a security vulnerability where an iframe is granted access to the 
            Payment Request API via the <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> attribute, which increases the attack surface
            and could potentially lead to financial fraud.
        </p>
        
        <div class="vulnerability">
            <strong>Security Issue:</strong> IFrame with <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> attribute that enables the content to 
            access sensitive payment capabilities and potentially initiate payment requests without sufficient context or security.

        <h2>Test Case</h2>
        
        <div class="test-container">
            <div class="code-label">Vulnerable code:</div>
            <pre><code>&lt;iframe

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        
        <div class="explanation">
            <p>The <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> attribute enables embedded content to use the Payment Request API, which provides a standardized way to handle payments on the web. This presents several security concerns:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Iframes could initiate payment requests that appear to come from the parent page</li>
                <li>Users may not realize they're authorizing a payment to a third-party rather than the site they're visiting</li>
                <li>Malicious content could potentially trick users into authorizing payments under false pretenses</li>
                <li>The payment API increases the overall attack surface of the application</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Payment capabilities should only be granted to fully trusted and secure content.</p>
            
            <h3>How Pink Sock detects this issue:</h3>
            <p>Pink Sock scans for iframe elements with the <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> attribute and flags them as a security risk, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities like missing sandbox protections or when loading cross-origin content.</p>
            
            <h3>How to fix:</h3>
            <p>Consider these approaches to mitigate the risk:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Only add <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> when absolutely necessary for payment functionality</li>
                <li>Only enable payment requests for trusted and verified content sources</li>
                <li>Use proper sandboxing alongside payment permissions</li>
                <li>Consider handling payments in the parent page instead of delegating to iframes</li>
                <li>Implement additional verification steps before payment processing</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If payment capability is necessary, combine it with appropriate protections:</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;iframe 
  src="../assets/iframe-content.html" 
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-payment-request"
  width="100%" 
  height="300"
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that you must also add <code>allow-payment-request</code> to the sandbox attribute if you're using sandboxing with payment requests.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        
        <div class="test-detail">
            <h3>Modern Alternatives</h3>
            <p>Similar to fullscreen, the <code>allowpaymentrequest</code> attribute is considered legacy. The modern approach is to use the Feature Policy through the <code>allow</code> attribute:</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;iframe 
  src="../assets/iframe-content.html" 
  allow="payment"
  width="100%" 
  height="300"
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This provides more control and can be combined with other feature policies in a single attribute.</p>
            
            <h3>Payment Request API Security Context</h3>
            <p>The Payment Request API is designed with several security considerations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It only works in secure contexts (HTTPS)</li>
                <li>Browsers often require user interaction before allowing payment requests</li>
                <li>The API provides clear disclosure about what is being purchased and from whom</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these protections don't fully mitigate the risks of enabling payment capabilities in untrusted iframes.</p>
            
            <h3>Risk Factors for Payment Requests</h3>
            <p>The risk level increases significantly when payment capabilities are combined with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross-origin content from untrusted sources</li>
                <li>Missing or insufficient sandbox protections</li>
                <li>Ability to modify parent page content</li>
                <li>Insufficient user education about payment authorization</li>
                <li>Misleading context or urgency that rushes users through payment confirmation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Financial capability should always be treated as high-risk and implemented with multiple layers of protection.</p>
